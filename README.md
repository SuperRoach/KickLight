KickLight
=========

Python class to control the Kick Light from Riftlabs

To use this, you will need a KickLight. 

Connect to it before using the class, as it needs to be able to have the ip assigned. 

The Kick uses Wi-Fi, and will hold its connection once made active. The light on the kick will stay red 
until the first command has been sent.
